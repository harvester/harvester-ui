# harvester-ui
[![Build Status](http://drone-publish.rancher.io/api/badges/rancher/harvester-ui/status.svg)](http://drone-publish.rancher.io/rancher/harvester-ui)

Harvester UI.  For the other Rancher UI see [rancher/ui](https://github.com/rancher/ui).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at https://localhost:8005
# using the endpoint for your Steve (or Rancher) API
$ API=http://localhost:8989 yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Running with standalone Steve on a Mac
 ```bash
 cd steve
 make run-host

 cd harvester-ui
 docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t rancher/harvester-ui:dev
 docker run -v $(pwd):/src \
   -v dashboard_node:/src/node_modules \
   -p 8005:8005 \
   -e API=http://172.17.0.1:8989 \
   rancher/harvester-ui:dev
 
 # The first time will take forever installing node_modules into the volume; it will be faster next time.
 #
 # Goto https://localhost:8005
```

### Creating a Steve user

Steve does not currently create any default user to login to when it is first run.  Use kubectl to apply this to create an `admin`/`admin` user:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3
kind: User
metadata:
  name: admin
principalIds:
  - local://admin
enabled: true
username: admin
# bcrypt hash of "admin" , or use e.g. https://bcrypt-generator.com/ to generate your own
password: $2a$10$lQpf/73orx5T3TBzbu.xNOXFgODGsR4wc39vTGc6Hbt8cdQVza.Pq
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: default-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: admin
```
